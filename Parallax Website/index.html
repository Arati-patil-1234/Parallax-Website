            Nature is everything that exists in the physical world and is not made by humans.
            <br>
            It includes:
            <br>
            Living things like animals, plants, insects, and microorganisms.
            <br>
            Non-living things like mountains, rivers, oceans, air, and soil
            <br>
            Natural forces like sunlight, wind, rain, and gravity
            Nature provides us with everything we need—air to breathe, water to drink, food to eat, and beautiful places
            to enjoy.
            It also supports all forms of life through ecosystems where living things interact with each other and their
            environment.
            In simple words, nature is the world around us that is natural and not created by people. It is important
            for our health,
            survival, and happiness.

            🌞Exploring the Nature means observing, experiencing, and understanding the natural world around us
            <br>
            including landscapes, plants, animals, weather, rivers, forests, mountains, oceans, and the balance of
            ecosystems.
            <br>
            It’s a way to connect with the Earth and appreciate its beauty, complexity, and life-supporting systems.🥀

        <h2>Section three</h2>
        <p>

            "Looking deep into nature" means going beyond just seeing the trees, sky, or animals
            it’s about truly observing, feeling, and understanding the hidden beauty, patterns, and connections in the
            natural world.
            <br>
            Albert Einstein once said:
            “Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.”
            <br>
            Here’s how you can begin to look deeply into nature:<br> <br>

            🌱 1. Slow Down and Observe<br>
            Take time to sit quietly in a natural place. Use your senses:<br>
            Look at the tiny details the veins of a leaf, movement of ants, or shapes of clouds.<br>
            Listen to birds, wind, rustling leaves, or flowing water.<br>
            Smell flowers, wet soil, or forest air.<br>
            Touch tree bark, stones, or soft moss.<br>
            <hr>

            🌀 2. Notice Patterns and Cycles<br>
            Nature has rhythm and order: <br>
            The rising and setting of the sun.<br>
            The changing of seasons.<br>
            The way leaves grow in a spiral or rivers curve.<br>
            You’ll see mathematics, balance, and design in everything — from a snowflake to a spider’s web.<br>
            <hr>

            🌿 3. Ask Questions <br>
            Why do birds fly in a "V" shape? <br>
            How do plants grow toward sunlight? <br>
            What role does each insect or animal play in the environment? <br>
            Asking questions leads to curiosity, and curiosity leads to deep understanding.<br>
            <hr>

            🌎 4. Connect Emotionally <br>
            Feel the peace of a silent forest, the energy of a storm, or the wonder of a starry sky. <br>
            Nature often mirrors our own emotions. When we feel lost, nature can ground us.<br>
            <hr>

            📚 5. Learn Through Science and Stories <br>
            Reading about ecosystems, geology, and wildlife helps you understand what you observe. <br>
            At the same time, poems and stories about nature let you feel it deeply in your heart.<br>
            <hr>

            🧘 6. Be Present and Mindful <br>
            Leave your phone aside. Just be in the moment. Watch a sunset without rushing. <br>
            Listen to a river without judgment. That’s when you truly start to see.<br>
            <hr>

            To look deep into nature is not just to observe it but,<br> to connect with it, learn from it, and respect
            its wisdom.
